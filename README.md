What is typescript?

TypeScript is the main language used by the official Angular team and the language you'll mostly see in Angular projects. It's a superset to JavaScript and makes writing Angular apps really easy. 



*   Optional static typing (the key here is optional)
*   Type Inference, which gives some of the benefits of types, without actually using them
*   Access to ES6 and ES7 features, before they become supported by major browsers
*   The ability to compile down to a version of JavaScript that runs on all browsers
